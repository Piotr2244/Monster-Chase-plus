# Monster-Chase-plus

This project is a 2D arcade game created in the Unity environment based on the freeCodeCamp.org tutorial. 
The version I am presenting is an extension of the one I created following the tutorial. 

I AM NOT the owner of the assets used, they were provided for free and used by me. 
The game was programmed by me while following the free tutorial, which I will provide a link to below. My version includes several extensions such as appearing coins, collecting points, searching for weapons, and the ability to shoot enemies. The game involves escaping from appearing monsters and collecting points.
